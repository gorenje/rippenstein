## Priceless Hearts

If you got this far, then you might have found a heart that you can't buy. A priceless heart.

{% include heart_image.html name="title-360.jpg" ovrcls="center" %}

Paper hearts are made to make you and others happy. To spread some love and happiness in times of hardship.

You can leave the heart where you found it or take it with you and put it somewhere else in the public space.

It's up to you - this is art for everyone.

So remember, if you make off with the heart and hide it away somewhere, then you are no better than an art investor who purchases artworks only for it to disappear in some [freeport](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geneva_Freeport&oldid=1083132905) at some airport somewhere.

The artwork is then lost to humankind.

It's locked away somewhere. No one has access to it. I'm fairly certain that this is not what the original artist intended for their artwork. All in the name of financial gain.

So instead how about making your own heart and spreading some more happiness and inspiration?

## Making Of

All you need is a [Silhouette Cameo](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/featured-product/cameo) and you're good to go! Or any other cutter for cardstock.

[Silhouette Studio](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/software) is the software that drives the Cameo. This Studio [A4 template](/f/i/heart/heart3d.studio3) cuts all the individual hearts. The template looks a little like this:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_04.png" desc="Cutter layout for A4"  %}

I'm using 300 gm/m<sup>2</sup> cardstock and once it's cut, it looks a little like this:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_08-360.jpg" desc="Cardstock that's been cut" %}

To layer the individual hearts, you'll need some plastic. The [A4 template](/f/i/heart/heart3d.studio3) assumes that the plastic cable has a diameter just under 2mm.

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_01-360.jpg" desc="Heart of hearts: plastic pin" %}

I melt one end of the pleastic so that the heart layers don't slide off. Then I start layering the cake:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_05-360.jpg" desc="Layer Cake Heart" %}

Once all hearts are layered, melt the other end of the plastic and voil√†, the final product:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_02-360.jpg"  %}

The final step is adding the magnets on the back but you might not need that - depending on your use case.

## About the Project

The aim is to share *anonymous* happiness: there is no expectation nor possibility for a response. It is part of making [small changes](https://millieons.org/t/smallchanges) to make the world a better place.

Additionally the project highlights that assumption that everything can be bought and sold. Money can't buy happiness, money can't buy these hearts.

The only way to purchase a heart is with your **conscience**: may you have guilty conscience if you remove beauty and happiness from the public space.

Finally, this project also tries to highlight how horrible [freeports](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geneva_Freeport&oldid=1083132905) are for art. Artworks that disappear into these havens are lost to humankind.
