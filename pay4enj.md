## Pay for Enjoyment Technology

Pay4Enj&reg; technology has been refined based on research of international funded myth-building co-operations.

A vast number of research groups have all come to the same conclusion on: the correlation between the freedom of a *ideas developer* (both new and old) and their respective financial freedoms. Research groups have discovered an overall (and quiet remarkable) one-to-one relation between ideas and financial freedoms: the more freedoms, the more ideas.

This surprisingly simple relationship has been proven to be complete, thorough and correct via many empirical studies.

The icebreaking technologies around Pay4Enj&reg; also allow *idea developers* to participate and fund events of  inebriated intellectual intercourse providing a wealth of wisdom and new ideas.

Pay4Enj&reg; builds on the  groundbreaking "Big Green Button" (BGB) technology developed in the late 1990s. Engagement with the BGB is initiated using click-technology installed into a pointer device. After that, the level of continued engagement, both financial and interactional, is directly related to the amount enjoyment had here.
