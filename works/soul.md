## Soul

{% include hearts_examples_frontpage.html name="140" %}

From [priceless hearts](/works/heart) to expensive souls. These are souls that can be bought.

<span class="quote">
Hearts are priceless, non-purchasable items of love.
<br>Souls are cheap, malleable, bought and sold to the highest bidder.
</span>
<span class="quote_signature">- Gregorius Rippenstein</span>

For a freely definable amount, [purchasable here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=SXBPWPT59LHFS).

## Is the soul a butterfly?

The soul is that caterpillar that grows inside of us. As it grows, we grow with it.

As the caterpillar begins its metamorphosis, our calling to change has come.

To reflect.

When the caterpillar becomes that butterfly, it leaves us an empty shell.

Ready for the ground.

Be aware of the metamorphosis of the soul. Listen to your soul. Listen to your conscience.

Make that change before the caterpillar can escape, before the caterpillar becomes the butterfly.

<hr style="width: 70%">

If you have a paper soul, you are holding an escaped soul. Give it back to someone who might be missing one.
