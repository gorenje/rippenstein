## Don't Give A Flower

<span class="quote">Why get pleasure out of watching something die?</span>
<span class="quote_signature">- Gregorius Rippenstein</span>

We all do it and we all have done it: purchase flowers for someone we love.

We then proceed to put those flowers into a vase with water. We then begin to observe the death struggle of those very same flowers. Once their beauty has dispersed, we end the flowers misery by throwing them away.

Next time purchase a flower in a pot.

Nurtue and love that flower as you do the person for whom you purchased the flower.
