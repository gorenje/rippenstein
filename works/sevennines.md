Feeling lost or small is far more common than you think. There are plenty of self-help books, guides, podcasts and blogs out there - Twitter to name just one.

The numbers are surprisingly bad and they seem to provide a clear indication that we are *all* alone and lost and that *most* of the time. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule - but they know who they are.
