## No War.

It's that simple: no wars.

Regardless of the consequences, there is no excusable reason for the suffering of millions of innocent people.

**When everyone is dead, there are no sides - neither good nor bad.**

No war is a good war: war is war. There are no defensive wars, there are no wars for freedom nor for democracy. There are only war that cause untold horrors and destruction.

**War does not lead to peace.**

War leaves death, misery, heartache and grief in its wake.
