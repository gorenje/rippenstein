The dimensionality of our personal take on reality has always been a point of interest for those who care. Gregorius has developed on this idea to provide something that not only provides exceptional dimensionality but also confronts us with our fears of dimensional loss.

Reducing three dimensionalism into two dimensional digitalism.

Gregorius has had many difficulties dealing with the three dimensional world especially in moments of inebriation. He has always had a desire to reduce three dimensionalimus to its shadowy two dimensional digital counterpart. Gregorius has achieved this through his project Urban Photogrammetry.
