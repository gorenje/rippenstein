## Don't Give A Flower

<span class="quote">Why get pleasure out of watching something die?</span>
<span class="quote_signature">- Gregorius Rippenstein</span>

We all do it and we all have done it: buy flowers for someone we love.

We then put those flowers into a vase with water. We then proceed to observe the death struggle of those very same flowers. Once their beauty has dispersed, we proceed to throw those flowers out.

Next time purchase a flower in a pot. Nurtue and love the flower as much as you do the person for whom you purchased the flower.
