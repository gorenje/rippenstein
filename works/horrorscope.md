Our future is shrouded in a fog of the unknown. Gregorius has taken it upon himself to make a change for the better. Having been spiritually touched, Gregorius has been lucky enough to peek behind the curtains of the unknown.

Traditional horoscopes are horribly general and can fit to nearly any situation, making them useless for everyday use. HorrorScopes are highly optimised providing a detailed and for some, accurate account of the future.

Having gained a large seven figure investment from the largest futuring fund, HorrorScopes will provide unbounded and unparalleled clarity into something that used to be fogified.

Powered by the DefogificationEngine&reg; and based on the latest advancement of IMT (Infinite Monkeys Technology&reg;), HorrorScope will provide the basis for Web 4.0 (Gregorius has seen the future).

Crystal Balls, Tarot Cards, Tea Leafs and other assorted earlier technologies have been integrated to provide core abilities beyond the usual collection of internet evolving technologies.

Anxiety of the future will become a thing of the past. Being replaced by a fear of the HorrorScope and its predictive prowess.

Gregorius, when interviewed to this work, describe it as a *poke in the eye for those with eyes*. Traditional horoscopes are generally non-specific but with enough interpretation, seem to fit to everyone everyday. But because of their interpretative nature, they predictive powers are limited or non-existent.

HorrorScopes, on the other hand, are dangerously specific however are correct as often as any good horoscope, i.e. 0.00001% of the time. The unfortunate feature is that when a HorrorScope happens to be correct, it only results in more misery for the world. And with that HorrorScopes have something in common with politics.
