## Hearts that can't be Bought

If you got this far then you might have found a heart that can't be bought.

Enjoy! The heart is meant to make you and others happy. You can leave the heart where you found it or take it with you. It's up to you. They are presents for everyone.

But remember, if you make off with the heart and hide it away somewhere, then you are no better than art investor who purchases artworks for future gain. The artwork disappears in some tax-free haven at some airport somewhere.

The artwork is lost to humankind. It's locked away somewhere. No one has access to it. I'm sure that's not what the original artist intended to happen to their artwork. All in the name of financial gain.

So instead how about making your own heart and spreading some more happiness and inspiration?

## Making Off

You can definitely make off with the heart but you can also read the making of and make your own.

Create hearts and spread happiness and inspiration.

All you need is a [Silhouette Cameo](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/featured-product/cameo) and you're good to go! Well that and some plastic ... and ideally some magnets... and a lot of patiences!

[Silhouette Studio](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/software) is the software for the Cameo. This [template](/f/i/heart/heart3d.studio3) provides all the hearts you need. That looks a little like this:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_04.png" desc="Cutter layout for A4"  %}

Putting some cardstock in the Cameo and after printing you have this:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_08-680.jpg" desc="Cardstock that's been cut" %}

To get all the layers together, you'll need some plastic:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_01-680.jpg" desc="Heart of hearts: plastic pin" %}

After removing some of the hearts:

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_07-680.jpg" desc="The emptiness of removed hearts" %}

You end up with a layer-cake

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_05-680.jpg" desc="Layer Cake Heart" %}

But the work was worth it, the final product

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_03-680.jpg" desc="Heart viewed from top" %}

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_09-680.jpg" desc="A twisted heart" %}

{% include heart_image.html name="making_off_02-680.jpg" desc="Sideview" %}

The final step is adding the magnets on the back but you might not need that - depending on your use case.

There is also a [3D Model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/pyramid-heart-7f7d9c37b3284048a43b2b9f43726e28).

## <a id="about" style="text-decoration: none; color: #eee">About the Project</a>

The aim is to share *anonymous* happiness: there is no expectation nor possibility for a response. It is part of making [small changes](https://millieons.org/t/smallchanges) to make the world a better place.

Additionally the project highlights that assumption that everything can be bought and sold. Money can't buy happiness, money can't buy these hearts.

But financially free does not mean free. As with free services in the internet, you still pay for hearts. In the internet you pay with your data, these hearts you pay with your **conscience**: may you have guilty conscience for removing beauty from the public space.

Also: this project **is not** about praising or selling Silhouette products. It's just the cutter/plotter that I have and using a knife isn't an option. **This project is in no way endorsed nor sponsored by any manufacturer of any of the tools that went into this project.**
