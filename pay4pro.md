## Pay for Procrastination Technology

Pay4Pro&reg; technology has been refined and honed on the basis of research carried out by internationally funded myth-building co-operations.

## Proven

A vast number of myth-researching groups have all come to the same conclusion on the correlation between the freedom of an *ideas developer* (sometimes known as *author*) and their respective financial freedoms (sometimes referred to as *bank account*). Research groups have concluded that there is an overall one-to-one relation between ideas and financial freedoms: *the more financial freedoms, the more ideas*.

## Simple

This surprisingly simple relationship has been confirmed by many empirical studies. The correlation - commonly known as *much money makes much motivation* - has been found to be complete, correct and thoroughly great.

## Extendable

In addition, the icebreaking technologies extend Pay4Pro&reg; to allow *idea developers* to participate in and occasionally fund events of inebriated intellectual intercourse providing a wealth of new ideas and headaches.

## Solid

Pay4Pro&reg; builds on the solidly proven BGB technology (aka *Big Green Button*) developed in the late 1990s. Engagement with the BGB is initiated using click-technology integrated into pointer devices. After that, the level of continued engagement, both financial and interactional, is directly related to the amount of procrastination enjoyed by reading these words.
